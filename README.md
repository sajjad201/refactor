# refactor

X: Your thoughts about the code. 
What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. 
How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. 
The more details that you can provide about the code 
(what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc


Y: Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc
